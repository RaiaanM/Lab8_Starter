1. A1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
2. A2) No.
3. A3) No cause we want to use end to end testing to ensure the functionality is working.
4. A4) Yes we would use the end to end testing because we would like to check every single function and element and feature seperately.
=======
A1) I would put the automated tests in the GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because on every push, I would want to know whether my code is functioning properly, and it makes sense for this portion of the pipeline to be automated.
No, checking if a function returns the correct output would be done in Unit Tests
No, because you would want to use end-to-end testing to make sure that the message is properly sent and received.
Yes, using an end-to-end test makes sense because it's an isolated function of the message feature (as the message feature involves presumably many different components of the project).
